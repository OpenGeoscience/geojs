=================================
Welcome to GeoJS's documentation!
=================================

GeoJS is a flexible library for all kinds of geospatial visualizations
from traditional point markers to 3D climatological simulations.  It is
designed for displaying large datasets (over 100,000 points) leveraging
the power of WebGL.  The programming interface was inspired by the widely
used `d3 <http://d3js.org/>`_ and allows the user to generate features from
arbitrary data objects with custom accessors.  The API also provides
custom mouse events that mimick browser level events, but work with
WebGL features and even through active layers.

See the growing list of `examples <http://opengeoscience.github.io/geojs/examples/index.html>`_
for a live demonstration of GeoJS's features or go to our Github
`repository <https://github.com/OpenGeoscience/geojs>`_ to start hacking.
